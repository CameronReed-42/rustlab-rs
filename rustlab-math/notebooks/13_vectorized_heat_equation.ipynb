    "# Vectorized Heat Equation Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a fully vectorized implementation of the 2D heat diffusion equation using RustLab's advanced array operations. We replace all manual loops with vectorized operations for maximum performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2D heat equation is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "∂T/∂t = α ∇²T\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- `T(x,y,t)` is temperature at position (x,y) and time t\n",
    "- `α` is thermal diffusivity\n",
    "- `∇²T` is the Laplacian operator\n",
    "\n",
    "Using finite differences:\n",
    "```\n",
    "∇²T ≈ (T[i+1,j] + T[i-1,j] + T[i,j+1] + T[i,j-1] - 4*T[i,j]) / dx²\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vectorization Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Loops**: Use array slicing instead of nested loops\n",
    "2. **Broadcasting**: Leverage automatic broadcasting for operations\n",
    "3. **Element-wise Operations**: Use `*`, `+`, `-` for temperature updates\n",
    "4. **Matrix Operations**: Use `^` for any matrix multiplications\n",
    "5. **Memory Efficiency**: Minimize temporary allocations"

    "This notebook showcases several critical vectorization patterns in RustLab:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Core Vectorization Strategies**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Array Slicing for Spatial Operations**\n",
    "   ```rust\n",
    "   let center = temperature.slice_2d_at((1..grid_size-1, 1..grid_size-1))?;\n",
    "   let north = temperature.slice_2d_at((0..grid_size-2, 1..grid_size-1))?;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Replaces nested loops with single operations\n",
    "   - Zero-copy views for memory efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Broadcasting for Mathematical Operations**\n",
    "   ```rust\n",
    "   let laplacian = &(&(&north + &south) + &(&east + &west)) - &(&center * 4.0);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Element-wise operations across entire arrays\n",
    "   - Automatic broadcasting for scalar operations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Vectorized Statistical Analysis**\n",
    "   ```rust\n",
    "   let total_energy = temperature.sum();\n",
    "   let max_temp = temperature.max();\n",
    "   let std_temp = temperature.std(Some(1));\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Built-in reductions replace manual calculations\n",
    "   - SIMD-optimized implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚡ **Performance Benefits**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory Efficiency**: Zero-copy slicing reduces allocations\n",
    "- **Cache Locality**: Contiguous memory access patterns\n",
    "- **SIMD Utilization**: Automatic vectorization for large arrays\n",
    "- **Reduced Branching**: Fewer conditional statements in inner loops\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔬 **Scientific Computing Advantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Readability**: Mathematical operations look like mathematical notation\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: Less code, fewer bugs\n",
    "- **Composability**: Easy to chain complex operations\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Performance benefits increase with problem size\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **RustLab-Specific Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Operator Distinction**: `^` for matrix math, `*` for element-wise\n",
    "- **Reference Semantics**: `&` prevents unnecessary copies\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: Compile-time dimension checking\n",
    "- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: High-level syntax with no runtime overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "This vectorized implementation demonstrates how RustLab enables writing scientific code that is both highly readable and extremely performant, replacing hundreds of lines of manual loop code with concise, mathematical expressions."

The heat equation is a classic example:\n\n```\nFor each interior point (i,j):\n    New[i,j] = f(Old[i-1,j], Old[i+1,j], Old[i,j-1], Old[i,j+1], Old[i,j])\n               ↑           ↑           ↑           ↑           ↑\n             North      South       West        East       Center\n```\n\n### Why Our Results Make Sense\n\nOur notebook revealed an important truth about scientific computing:\n\n| Approach | What It Does | Why It Performed That Way |\n|----------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| **Original Vectorized (Cell 3)** | Creates array slices for neighbors, uses element-wise ops | ❌ Slower: Too many temporary arrays |\n| **Optimized Vectorized (Cell 7)** | Reuses workspace, minimizes allocations | ✅ Faster: Good memory usage, SIMD benefits |\n| **Matrix Approach (Cell 9)** | Converts stencil to dense N×N matrix | ❌ Much slower: Wrong tool for the job |\n\n### The Key Insight: Sparse vs Dense\n\nThe heat equation stencil is **inherently sparse** - each point only interacts with 5 neighbors out of N² total points:\n\n```\nStencil: 5 operations per point → O(N) total work\nMatrix:  N operations per point → O(N²) total work\n```\n\nConverting this to a dense matrix multiplication is like:\n- **Using a sledgehammer to crack a nut** \n- **Driving across town to visit your neighbor**\n\n### When Each Approach Wins\n\n**✅ RustLab Vectorization Works Well For:**\n- Element-wise operations on large arrays\n- Problems that are naturally dense matrix operations\n- Statistical reductions (sum, mean, max)\n- Linear algebra (eigenvalues, SVD, etc.)\n\n**❌ RustLab Vectorization Struggles With:**\n- Sparse stencil patterns\n- Small problem sizes (overhead dominates)\n- Operations requiring many temporary arrays\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\nOur experiments show that **RustLab's vectorization CAN beat loops** when:\n1. You minimize allocations (optimized approach)\n2. The problem size is large enough (>1000 elements)\n3. You're doing dense operations (not sparse stencils)\n\nBut for **stencil operations specifically**, you're better off with:\n- Simple loops for small problems\n- Specialized stencil libraries for large problems\n- GPU acceleration for massive problems\n\n**The lesson**: Understanding your problem's structure (dense vs sparse, local vs global) is more important than blindly applying vectorization!",
