    "# Vectorized Heat Equation Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a fully vectorized implementation of the 2D heat diffusion equation using RustLab's advanced array operations. We replace all manual loops with vectorized operations for maximum performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2D heat equation is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "∂T/∂t = α ∇²T\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- `T(x,y,t)` is temperature at position (x,y) and time t\n",
    "- `α` is thermal diffusivity\n",
    "- `∇²T` is the Laplacian operator\n",
    "\n",
    "Using finite differences:\n",
    "```\n",
    "∇²T ≈ (T[i+1,j] + T[i-1,j] + T[i,j+1] + T[i,j-1] - 4*T[i,j]) / dx²\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vectorization Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Loops**: Use array slicing instead of nested loops\n",
    "2. **Broadcasting**: Leverage automatic broadcasting for operations\n",
    "3. **Element-wise Operations**: Use `*`, `+`, `-` for temperature updates\n",
    "4. **Matrix Operations**: Use `^` for any matrix multiplications\n",
    "5. **Memory Efficiency**: Minimize temporary allocations"

    "## Key Vectorization Techniques Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook showcases several critical vectorization patterns in RustLab:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Core Vectorization Strategies**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Array Slicing for Spatial Operations**\n",
    "   ```rust\n",
    "   let center = temperature.slice_2d_at((1..grid_size-1, 1..grid_size-1))?;\n",
    "   let north = temperature.slice_2d_at((0..grid_size-2, 1..grid_size-1))?;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Replaces nested loops with single operations\n",
    "   - Zero-copy views for memory efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Broadcasting for Mathematical Operations**\n",
    "   ```rust\n",
    "   let laplacian = &(&(&north + &south) + &(&east + &west)) - &(&center * 4.0);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Element-wise operations across entire arrays\n",
    "   - Automatic broadcasting for scalar operations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Vectorized Statistical Analysis**\n",
    "   ```rust\n",
    "   let total_energy = temperature.sum();\n",
    "   let max_temp = temperature.max();\n",
    "   let std_temp = temperature.std(Some(1));\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Built-in reductions replace manual calculations\n",
    "   - SIMD-optimized implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚡ **Performance Benefits**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory Efficiency**: Zero-copy slicing reduces allocations\n",
    "- **Cache Locality**: Contiguous memory access patterns\n",
    "- **SIMD Utilization**: Automatic vectorization for large arrays\n",
    "- **Reduced Branching**: Fewer conditional statements in inner loops\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔬 **Scientific Computing Advantages**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Readability**: Mathematical operations look like mathematical notation\n",
    "- **Maintainability**: Less code, fewer bugs\n",
    "- **Composability**: Easy to chain complex operations\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Performance benefits increase with problem size\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **RustLab-Specific Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Operator Distinction**: `^` for matrix math, `*` for element-wise\n",
    "- **Reference Semantics**: `&` prevents unnecessary copies\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: Compile-time dimension checking\n",
    "- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: High-level syntax with no runtime overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "This vectorized implementation demonstrates how RustLab enables writing scientific code that is both highly readable and extremely performant, replacing hundreds of lines of manual loop code with concise, mathematical expressions."
